#./clio.sh push action fio.fee createfee '{"end_point":"add_pub_address","type":1,"suf_amount":210000000}' -p fio.fee
# As fees are quite small multiple createfees may be included in one msig
./clio.sh push action fio.fee createfee '{"end_point":"audit_vote","type":0,"suf_amount":5400000000}' -p fio.fee
